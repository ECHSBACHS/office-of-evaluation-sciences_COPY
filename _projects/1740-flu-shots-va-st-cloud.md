## What was the challenge?

Flu causes between 9 million and 36 million illnesses and between 12,000 and 56,000 deaths in the United States annually. Despite the seriousness of the flu, many people do not get an annual flu shot. The VA provides free flu shots to enrolled veterans and sets annual targets for flu shot uptake.

## What was the program change?

In collaboration with the St. Cloud VA Health Care System,  the Office of Evaluation Sciences (OES) designed three different postcards to send to enrolled veterans: an information-only postcard, which provided details on how to get a flu shot, and two postcards informed by insights from the behavioral sciences â€” one designed to increase motivation, the other designed to facilitate implementation.

## How did the evaluation work?

Veterans were randomly assigned to receive one of three postcards: an information-only postcard, a motivation postcard, or an implementation postcard. Data from VA electronic health records were used to compare flu shot uptake  and timing among the three groups between September 14, 2017, and May 1, 2018.

## What was the impact?

We did not observe any significant differences among the three postcards in either uptake or timing of flu shots.
